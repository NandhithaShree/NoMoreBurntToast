## Techincal details

### Stack

The project uses React Native with [Expo](https://expo.dev) for frontend and Firebase for backend, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, smooth deployment, and providing a reliable user experience. We are currently working on prototyping the navigation flow and UI design, but we don't have concrete progress to show yet.

For version control, we have decided to use one main Git branch for ease of development with only two people. However, milestone builds are tagged and future extensions after main features will be developed on separate branches.

### Deployed development build

Our chosen libraries do not support web builds, so the only fully working and debugged build is the iOS development build. Android development build is WIP.

### Running the project

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
<!-- - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo -->
